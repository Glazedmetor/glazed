🍩 DonutSMP Meteor Client Addon
Glazed is a free Meteor Client addon designed specifically for the DonutSMP server. I made this to automate the boring and repetitive tasks I kept doing in-game and to give others access to high-quality tools without paying. I've seen many paid clients that do less than this one — this is my free alternative.
